# Roam Research Skill

## Overview
Claude can manage your Roam Research database to capture thoughts, create bidirectional links, build a networked knowledge base, and query your notes. A tool for networked thought.

## Quick Install

```bash
curl -sSL https://canifi.com/skills/roam-research/install.sh | bash
```

Or manually:
```bash
cp -r skills/roam-research ~/.canifi/skills/
```

## Setup

Configure via [canifi-env](https://canifi.com/setup/scripts):

```bash
# First, ensure canifi-env is installed:
# curl -sSL https://canifi.com/install.sh | bash

canifi-env set ROAM_EMAIL "your-email@example.com"
```

## Privacy & Authentication

**Your credentials, your choice.** Canifi LifeOS respects your privacy.

### Option 1: Manual Browser Login (Recommended)
If you prefer not to share credentials with Claude Code:
1. Complete the [Browser Automation Setup](/setup/automation) using CDP mode
2. Login to the service manually in the Playwright-controlled Chrome window
3. Claude will use your authenticated session without ever seeing your password

### Option 2: Environment Variables
If you're comfortable sharing credentials, you can store them locally:
```bash
canifi-env set SERVICE_EMAIL "your-email"
canifi-env set SERVICE_PASSWORD "your-password"
```

**Note**: Credentials stored in canifi-env are only accessible locally on your machine and are never transmitted.

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Add to Daily Note

        Confirms: "Added to today's daily note"
```

### Example 2: Create Page

User: "Create a page for Project Alpha with key details"
Claude: Creates [[Project Alpha]] page, adds initial content.
        Returns: "Created Project Alpha page"
```

### Example 3: Search Links
```
User: "Find all pages linking to Machine Learning"
Claude: Checks backlinks for [[Machine Learning]].
        Reports: "12 pages reference Machine Learning: Neural Networks, Deep Learning..."
```

### Example 4: Query Notes
```
User: "Find all my TODOs from this week"
Claude: Runs query for TODO items with date filter.
        Reports: "8 TODOs this week: Review proposal, Update docs..."
```

## Authentication Flow
1. Claude navigates to roamresearch.com via Playwright MCP
2. Enters ROAM_EMAIL for authentication
3. Handles 2FA if required (notifies user via iMessage)
4. Maintains session for graph operations
