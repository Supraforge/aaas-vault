# Google Calendar Skill

## Overview
Claude can manage your Google Calendar to create events, schedule meetings, set reminders, check availability, and organize your time. This includes working with multiple calendars, sending invites, and managing recurring events.

## Quick Install

```bash
curl -sSL https://canifi.com/skills/google-calendar/install.sh | bash
```

Or manually:
```bash
cp -r skills/google-calendar ~/.canifi/skills/
```

## Setup

Configure via [canifi-env](https://canifi.com/setup/scripts):

```bash
# First, ensure canifi-env is installed:
# curl -sSL https://canifi.com/install.sh | bash

canifi-env set GOOGLE_EMAIL "your-email@gmail.com"
```

## Privacy & Authentication

**Your credentials, your choice.** Canifi LifeOS respects your privacy.

### Option 1: Manual Browser Login (Recommended)
If you prefer not to share credentials with Claude Code:
1. Complete the [Browser Automation Setup](/setup/automation) using CDP mode
2. Login to the service manually in the Playwright-controlled Chrome window
3. Claude will use your authenticated session without ever seeing your password

### Option 2: Environment Variables
If you're comfortable sharing credentials, you can store them locally:
```bash
canifi-env set SERVICE_EMAIL "your-email"
canifi-env set SERVICE_PASSWORD "your-password"
```

**Note**: Credentials stored in canifi-env are only accessible locally on your machine and are never transmitted.

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Create Event
```

        adds to primary calendar. Returns: "Created: Team Meeting tomorrow 2-3pm"
```

### Example 2: Check Schedule
```
User: "What do I have scheduled this week?"
Claude: Opens week view, reads all events. Reports:
        "This week: Monday - Team standup 9am, Client call 2pm..."
```

### Example 3: Find Free Time
```
User: "When am I free for a 2-hour meeting this week?"
Claude: Analyzes week's schedule, identifies gaps of 2+ hours.
        Reports: "Available slots: Tuesday 10am-12pm, Wednesday 1-4pm..."
```

### Example 4: Create Recurring Event
```
User: "Set up a weekly 1-on-1 with Sarah every Monday at 10am"
Claude: Creates recurring event "1-on-1 with Sarah" every Monday 10am,
        adds Sarah as attendee, sends invite. Confirms: "Recurring meeting created"
```

## Authentication Flow
1. Claude navigates to calendar.google.com via Playwright MCP
2. Authenticates with GOOGLE_EMAIL if needed
3. Handles 2FA if prompted (notifies user via iMessage)
4. Maintains session for subsequent calendar operations
