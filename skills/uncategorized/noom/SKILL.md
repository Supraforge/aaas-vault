Or manually:
```bash
cp -r skills/noom ~/.canifi/skills/
```

## Setup

## Privacy & Authentication

**Your credentials, your choice.** Canifi LifeOS respects your privacy.

If you prefer not to share credentials with Claude Code:
1. Complete the [Browser Automation Setup](/setup/automation) using CDP mode
2. Login to the service manually in the Playwright-controlled Chrome window
