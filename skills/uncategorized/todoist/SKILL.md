# Todoist Skill

## Overview
Claude can manage your Todoist tasks to capture to-dos, organize with projects and labels, set priorities and due dates, and track productivity. A powerful task management system with natural language input.

## Quick Install

```bash
curl -sSL https://canifi.com/skills/todoist/install.sh | bash
```

Or manually:
```bash
cp -r skills/todoist ~/.canifi/skills/
```

## Setup

Configure via [canifi-env](https://canifi.com/setup/scripts):

```bash
# First, ensure canifi-env is installed:
# curl -sSL https://canifi.com/install.sh | bash

canifi-env set TODOIST_EMAIL "your-email@example.com"
```

## Privacy & Authentication

**Your credentials, your choice.** Canifi LifeOS respects your privacy.

### Option 1: Manual Browser Login (Recommended)
If you prefer not to share credentials with Claude Code:
1. Complete the [Browser Automation Setup](/setup/automation) using CDP mode
2. Login to the service manually in the Playwright-controlled Chrome window
3. Claude will use your authenticated session without ever seeing your password

### Option 2: Environment Variables
If you're comfortable sharing credentials, you can store them locally:
```bash
canifi-env set SERVICE_EMAIL "your-email"
canifi-env set SERVICE_PASSWORD "your-password"
```

**Note**: Credentials stored in canifi-env are only accessible locally on your machine and are never transmitted.

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Quick Add Task
```
User: "Add to Todoist: Call dentist tomorrow at 3pm p1"
Claude: Uses natural language parsing to create task with
        due date tomorrow 3pm, priority 1.
        Confirms: "Task created: Call dentist (Tomorrow 3pm, P1)"
```

### Example 2: View Today's Tasks
```
User: "What's on my Todoist for today?"
Claude: Opens Today view, lists tasks.
        Reports: "8 tasks today:
        1. [P1] Submit report (Work)
        2. [P2] Team meeting at 2pm..."
```

### Example 3: Organize Project
```
User: "Create a 'House Renovation' project with sections for Kitchen, Bathroom, Living Room"
Claude: Creates project with three sections.
        Confirms: "Created project with 3 sections"
```

### Example 4: Recurring Task
```
User: "Add a task to review goals every Sunday at 6pm"
Claude: Creates recurring task "Review goals" every Sunday 6pm.
        Confirms: "Recurring task created for Sundays 6pm"
```

## Authentication Flow
1. Claude navigates to todoist.com via Playwright MCP
2. Enters TODOIST_EMAIL for authentication
3. Handles 2FA if required (notifies user via iMessage)
4. Maintains session for task operations

## Selectors Reference
```javascript
// Quick add button
'[aria-label="Quick Add"]' or 'button.quick_add'

// Task input
'.task_editor__input'

// Project list
'.left_menu'

// Today view
'[aria-label="Today"]'

// Task item
'.task_list_item'

// Complete button
'.task_checkbox'

// Priority selector
'[aria-label="Priority"]'

// Due date picker
'[aria-label="Due date"]'

// Labels
'[aria-label="Labels"]'

// Add subtask
'[aria-label="Add sub-task"]'
```

## Natural Language Examples
```
"Buy milk tomorrow" → Task: Buy milk, Due: Tomorrow
"Meeting with John every Monday 10am" → Recurring weekly
"Submit report p1 #Work @urgent" → P1, Project: Work, Label: urgent
"Call mom +1 day" → Due: Day after tomorrow
"Review code in 2 hours" → Due: 2 hours from now
```

## Error Handling
- **Login Failed**: Retry 3 times, notify user via iMessage
- **Session Expired**: Re-authenticate automatically
- **Task Create Failed**: Retry, save locally as backup
- **Date Parse Failed**: Ask for clarification
- **Project Not Found**: Create project or ask user
- **Sync Failed**: Wait and retry
