# Gemini Nano Banana Skill

## Overview
Claude can use Gemini's Nano Banana feature (via gemini.google.com) to generate images, logos, icons, and visual assets. This is the primary tool for creating development assets, UI mockups, and graphic design elements.

## Quick Install

```bash
curl -sSL https://canifi.com/skills/gemini-nano-banana/install.sh | bash
```

Or manually:
```bash
cp -r skills/gemini-nano-banana ~/.canifi/skills/
```

## Setup

Configure via [canifi-env](https://canifi.com/setup/scripts):

```bash
# First, ensure canifi-env is installed:
# curl -sSL https://canifi.com/install.sh | bash

canifi-env set GOOGLE_EMAIL "your-email@gmail.com"
```

## Privacy & Authentication

**Your credentials, your choice.** Canifi LifeOS respects your privacy.

### Option 1: Manual Browser Login (Recommended)
If you prefer not to share credentials with Claude Code:
1. Complete the [Browser Automation Setup](/setup/automation) using CDP mode
2. Login to the service manually in the Playwright-controlled Chrome window
3. Claude will use your authenticated session without ever seeing your password

### Option 2: Environment Variables
If you're comfortable sharing credentials, you can store them locally:
```bash
canifi-env set SERVICE_EMAIL "your-email"
canifi-env set SERVICE_PASSWORD "your-password"
```

**Note**: Credentials stored in canifi-env are only accessible locally on your machine and are never transmitted.

## Authentication Flow
1. Claude navigates to gemini.google.com via Playwright MCP
2. Authenticates with GOOGLE_EMAIL if needed
3. Handles 2FA if prompted (notifies user via iMessage)
4. Accesses image generation feature

## Image Generation Process
```
1. Navigate to gemini.google.com
2. Enter image generation prompt
3. Wait for generation (typically 10-30 seconds)
4. Review generated options
5. Download preferred image(s)
6. Provide to user or save to project
```

## Selectors Reference
```javascript
// Chat input
'[aria-label="Enter a prompt here"]' or 'rich-textarea'

// Submit button
'[aria-label="Send message"]'

// Generated images
'.generated-image' or 'img[alt*="Generated"]'

// Download button
'[aria-label="Download"]'

// Regenerate button
'[aria-label="Regenerate"]'

// Image options
'.image-option'

// Response container
'.model-response'
```

## Prompt Best Practices
```
Logo Prompts:
- Specify style: minimalist, vintage, modern, playful
- Define colors: "blue and white", "gradient from X to Y"
- Mention use case: "for tech startup", "for mobile app"

UI Mockups:
- Specify device: mobile, tablet, desktop
- Describe layout: dashboard, list view, card layout
- Include content hints: what data should appear

Icons:
- Define style: outline, filled, flat, 3D
- Specify size context: "for navigation bar"
- Request consistency: "matching style to existing set"
```

## Error Handling
- **Login Failed**: Retry 3 times, notify user via iMessage
- **Session Expired**: Re-authenticate automatically
- **Generation Failed**: Retry with modified prompt
- **Content Policy Block**: Rephrase prompt to comply with policies
- **Download Failed**: Retry download, try alternative method
- **Quality Issues**: Regenerate with more specific prompt
