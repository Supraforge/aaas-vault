# Later Skill

Manage visual social media scheduling with Later's Instagram-focused platform.

## Quick Install

```bash
curl -sSL https://canifi.com/skills/later/install.sh | bash
```

Or manually:
```bash
cp -r skills/later ~/.canifi/skills/
```

## Setup

Configure via [canifi-env](https://canifi.com/setup/scripts):

## Privacy & Authentication

**Your credentials, your choice.** Canifi LifeOS respects your privacy.

### Option 1: Manual Browser Login (Recommended)
If you prefer not to share credentials with Claude Code:

### Option 2: Environment Variables
If you're comfortable sharing credentials, you can store them locally:
